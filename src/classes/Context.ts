     * - "pre-delay": Like "delay", syncs to the refresh cycle, but calls then on the context refresh cycle - without waiting for the hosts to have rendered.
     * - "await": Awaits each listener (simultaneously) and returns a promise. By default returns the last non-`undefined` value, combine with "multi" to return an array of awaited values (skipping `undefined`).
     *      * Exceptionally if "delay" is on, and there's no "await" then can only return `undefined`, as there's no promise to capture the timed out returns.
     * - "multi": This is the default mode: returns an array of values ignoring any `undefined`.
     *      * Inputting this mode makes no difference. It's just provided for typing convenience when wants a list of answers without anything else (instead of inputting "").
     * - "last": Use this to return the last acceptable value (by default ignoring any `undefined`) - instead of an array of values.
     * - "first": Stops the listening at the first value that is not `undefined` (and not skipped by "no-false" or "no-null"), and returns that single value.
     *      * Note that "first" does not stop the flow when using "await" as the async calls are made simultaneously. But it returns the first acceptable value.
     * - "first-true": Is like "first" but stops only if value amounts to true like: !!value.
     * - "no-false": Ignores any falsifiable values, only accepts: `(!!value)`. So most commonly ignored are: `false`, `0`, `""`, `nullÂ´, `undefined`.
     * - "no-null": Ignores any `null` values in addition to `undefined`. (By default only ignores `undefined`.)
     *      * Note also that when returning values, any signal that was connected with .Deferred flag will always be ignored from the return value flow (and called 0ms later, in addition to "delay" timeout).
