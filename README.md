## MixDOM

MixDOM is a state based DOM rendering library for JavaScript/TypeScript. It provides a sophisticated framework for building user interfaces all the way up to complex application with several laterally interrelated parts - using integrated contexts with their data and actions (and questions). It's designed to be performant with a flexible architecture to fit various different circumstances. Get the most out of MixDOM by using a JSX compiler and TypeScript - everything is typed.
